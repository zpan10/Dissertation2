\chapter{Gnu Things are Good Things for all Graduate Students or so it Seems}
\label{chap:golfing}

\section{Gnu See, Gnu Do, Gnu Goes Golfing with Green Golf Genes and
  Gesticulates Grapes}

So why do gnus do what they do?  This is a perennial question that has
yet to be answered definitively by scientists.  Is their future
somehow tied inexplicably with that of humans?  Hard to say, but we do
feed them a lot.  It has even been theorized that rotundness is a
symbol of status or class within the Gnus; those who are more
productive (i.e., cute, furry, friendly) will be fed more than those
who are less so.  So the more rotund, the higher status one has in the
Gnu society.

One could extrapolate this to mean that there is a super-Gnu out there
somewhere; the biggest, rotundest Gnu that you've ever seen, probably
of epic proportions!  This would have to be the Leader of Gnus, or LoG
for short.  But the LoG would definitely have to be the cutest,
furriest, and most friendly Gnu that you've ever seen.

\subsection{The LoG}

So how does the LoG get chosen?  Ultimately by humans.  So we can say
that the Gnu society is perhaps the truest democracy that has ever
existed; the leader is chosen by merit, and chosen by complete
outsiders.  As such, the LoG must truly epitomize all that Gnus stand
for: opposedness to overmanagement, cuteness, friendliness, and
furriness~\citep{gloonson98:_gnuly_discov_gnus}.  The gnus themselves
vote at an anual election, based upon these attributes (campagaining
is an anethema to Gnus; see Section~\ref{sec:groovin-gnus}).

\subsubsection{Election Data}
\label{sec:data}

Table~\ref{tbl:votes} shows the latest electoral college voting by the
LoG for the year 2000.  Each Gnu is scored on a scale of one to ten on
the attributes described above.  The results shown in the table are
average scores in each category for all votes; the Gnu's final score
is shown in the final column.

% Be aware that page-spanning tables a Very Odd Creatures.  The
% "longtable" environment in LaTeX does some deep Voodoo to make
% everything work out properly.  One of its deep incantations is to
% make the table appear as though it is double spaced.  You can fix
% this by trailing each line with "\\[-6em]" instead of just "\\".
% When using longtable it is also important to compile your file
% more than once. But you're probably already doing this to get
% the internal references correct, anyway.

As you can see from Table~\ref{tbl:votes}, George (my favorite Gnu)
won for the year 2000, with an aggregate score of 7.6.
